# Fake Truth- LSTM based fake-news detection

* This Android app is designed to detect fake news by utilizing a combination of a trained LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Network (Python) and Beautiful Soup (Java) for web scraping. The core of the fake news detection is powered by a trained PyTorch model with 94.47% accuracy on the WELFake Dataset that analyzes the content of news articles to determine their authenticity.

* The app is user-friendly, allowing users to input a news article URL. It then scrapes the web-page using Beautiful Soup and processes the input using the locally-bundled LSTM model to predict whether the news is real or fake.
